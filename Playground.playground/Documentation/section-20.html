    <p>Way cooler. <code>map</code> is a function on <code>Array</code> that invokes the closure you pass it on each member of that array. <code>map</code> returns a <em>new array</em> containing the return values of that closure, with the order corresponding to that of the original array. <code>map</code> is <em>very commonly used</em> in functional programming. It helps us avoid state and sets up our computations as a result of a function invocation. Super cool. </p>
<p>Let&#39;s say we want to get the people who still have yet to celebrate their birthday <em>this year</em>. To do so imperatively, we&#39;d use this function. </p>
