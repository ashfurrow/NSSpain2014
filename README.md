NSSpain 2014
================

Here's an (annotated) version of the playground I used in my [NSSpain 2014](http://nsspain.com/2014/) presentation on functional programming in Swift.  Slides are available [here](https://speakerdeck.com/ashfurrow/the-future-of-functional-programming-on-ios).

Many thanks to [Jason Sandmeyer](https://github.com/jas) for his [Swift Playground Builder](https://github.com/jas/swift-playground-builder).
